1.  This is creating a test block that will set a variable __name__ to the value __main__ of if it's being imported from another module it will set __name__ to the module's name.  This will then run all of the code within the block.  We can use this approach if we want to run a standalone program and test it.

2.  from myModule import myfunc as f
    myModule

3.  
even = [0,2,4,6,8]
odd = [1,3,5,7,9]

myList = [sum(i) for i in zip(even,odd)]
print(myList)

4.  When running this code, the for loop never ends.  I believe this is happening because you never tell it stop going through the rather just incrementing by one forever.

5.  
def getsum(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + getsum(n-1)
